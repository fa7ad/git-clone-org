# git-clone-org
---
Clone all repos from a github organization

## Usage:
```bash
git clone-org myawesometeam
```
Where **myawesometeam** is the github organization.
_Protip: if you have GITHUB_USER and GITHUB_PASSWORD set for [hub](http://hub.github.com), you can just skip the username and password input (Press enter twice)_

## Installation:
* Clone this repo into a new virtualenv (or you can go global)
* Install the requirements:
    `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Run `bash install.sh`
No idea about Windows :3

_Note: This script is very rudimentary, make a PR if you wanna add some cool feature._
